# MyMLModels

This repository serves as a collection of machine learning concepts and models that I am learning and experimenting with. It includes a variety of projects as I progress through different ML techniques.

## Project Overview

As I learn new machine-learning topics, I will post my projects and experiments here. Each notebook will cover a specific concept, model, or technique I am studying.

### Current Projects:
- **MNIST Digit Classifier**: A simple neural network model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Relevant libraries will be used depending on the project (TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, etc.)

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyMLModels.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies as listed in the project notebooks.

3. Explore the notebooks to understand the concepts and techniques.

## Future Additions:
- More machine learning algorithms and projects as I continue learning.
  
Feel free to follow along and contribute!
